# Hermes-Lite-2-PA-Measurements

The Hermes Lite 2 was designed to use the LDMOS AFT05MS003N with 5 watt output.

I was sent a pair of LDMOS AFT05MS004N from Steve Haynal.

First a took measurements of the HL2 with the 003's still in the unit to get a baseline for comparison.

Test equipment used.

Seglent SSA 3021X Spectrum Analyzer

Agilent E4418B EPM Series Power Meter

Bird 8329-300 2kW oil-cooled RF attenuator

HP 8482H Power Sensor

Siglent SDM 3055 5 Â½ Digits Digital Multimeter

Two feedback resistors 270 ohm R92 and R99 were replace with 220 ohm resistors.
